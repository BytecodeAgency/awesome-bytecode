## Programming technologies

_Technologies we love to use at Bytecode_

### Languages

* Javascript and NodeJS, "the language of the web"
* Typescript,typed superset of Javascript more suitable for enterprises
* Deno, TS runtime that has great potential (it's like NodeJS but better and with Typescript)
* GoLang, open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software
* Elixir, functional programming language built on top of Erlang
* Rust, low-level language capable of replacing C in many fields
* Elm, strictly functional front-end web language
* Python, high-level scripting language that reads like pseudo code
* HTML/CSS, the code that makes websites look pretty

### Frameworks

* ReactJS, very popular front-end framework
* React-Native, way of creating native mobile apps with React code
* Expo, framework that takes a way most of the React-Native headaches
* Phoenix, high-performing web framework for Elixir applications
